                <li className='commissionProcessLI'>To inquire about a commission, you will reach out to me via email, my contact link, or by DMâ€™ing me on my Instagram, Tik-Tok, or Patreon.</li>
                <li className='commissionProcessLI'>I will review your response and get back to you if I accept your inquiry. Prices for digital art are posted below. Commissions for other artwork such as paintings, clothing, or other custom work vary based on the cost of materials and time for art. Generally, if all materials are provided by the client, I will charge roughly $50 per hour of work the project requires.</li>
                <li className='commissionProcessLI'>Upon the approval of your project, payment will need to be provided in FULL before I start the commission. Payments can be made via Venmo, Cashapp, or Paypal.</li>
                <li className='commissionProcessLI'>You will recieve updates on the project and you can provide reasonable feedback up to three times. Revisions towards the end of the commissions creation will not be accepted unless minor, such as text changes in digital art.</li>
                <li className='commissionProcessLI'>Once completed, I will send you the final files of the digital art, or ship you the item and provide a tracking number. Please note for shipped items, you will be asked to cover the cost of shipping of your choice.</li>
